Landsat data for bird species richness prediction
The script utilizes the rgee package, which connects Google Earth Engine with the R programming language. The data is obtained from Landsat satellites, covering the time period from 2014 to 2018. Vegetation indices are then calculated from the individual bands. All of this is done within the framework of the KFME grid.
